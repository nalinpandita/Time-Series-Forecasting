# Time-Series-Forecasting
‚è≥ Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting using a combination of statistical models and deep learning techniques. The objective is to analyze historical data, capture underlying patterns, and make accurate future predictions.

AR, MA, ARIMA Models: Achieved an MSE of 38.4, indicating strong performance in capturing temporal dependencies and making accurate predictions.
LSTM and VAR Models: Reported an MSE of 67, reflecting the complexity of tuning deep learning models for time series and the potential for further optimization.

Python: Primary programming language for implementation.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
